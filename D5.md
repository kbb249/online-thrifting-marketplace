# D.5 Design
## Description
LinkU is an online thrifting marketplace that aims to provide a solution for the problem of unsafe and disorganized second-hand markets through social media platforms. Many NAU students risk meeting unknown sellers, experience unreliable transactions, and lack an affordable system for selling used items. Our goals with LinkU will allow student verification status, organization with listing and buying items, as well as support safe pickups at campus locations. Our product strives to deliver safer transactions, reduced risk, and a provided platform dedicated to student needs. LinkU targets students who have previously bought or sold second-hand items on campus and want a safer, more organized and secure way to carry out these transactions. 

To use this system, a User must register using an email, username, and password. Then the system verifies if the email address is a valid university email. Only verified students can access the platform. Once verified, the user can act both as a Buyer and Seller. When a Buyer decides to buy an item, they create a new Order. Each order has an order id, total amount, tax, and order date. As we want buyers to access and place orders from listings we also need the sellers to be able to post listings with title, description, photos, pricing, and category. A Seller can edit or delete their listing as needed. Each Seller profile should contain their name, contact information, Listings, and their current overall rating. On campus there will be drop off/pick up lockers, which will have several Locker Boxes. Every Locker Box has a locker id, status, location, and access code. Once the purchase is confirmed, the Seller will go to the locker box and drop off the order into the correct Locker Box by inputting the generated code. The buyer can then go to the Locker Box and collect the order by entering the generated code. The basis for the transaction being done through the locker Box allows for the privacy and security of both parties, the buyer and seller.
