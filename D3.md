# D3. Analysis
## 1. System Description
LinkU is an online thrifting marketplace that aims to provide a solution for the problem of unsafe and disorganized second-hand markets through social media platforms. Many NAU students risk meeting unknown sellers, experience unreliable transactions, and lack an affordable system for selling used items. Our goals with LinkU will allow student verification status, organization with listing and buying items, as well as support safe pickups at campus locations; in contradiction to Snapchat or Facebook Marketplace. Our product strives to deliver safer transactions, reduced risk, and a provided platform dedicated to student needs. LinkU targets students who have previously bought or sold second-hand items on campus and want a safer, more organized and secure way to carry out these transactions. 

To use this system, a **User** must register using an *email*, *username*, and *password*. Then the system verifies if the email address is a valid university email. Only verified students can access the platform. Once verified, the user can act both as a **Buyer** and **Seller**. A **Buyer** can **_browse_**, **_search_**, and **_filter_** through all the available listings. When a **Buyer** decides to buy an item, they create a new **Order**. Each **order** has an *order id*, *total amount*, *tax*, and *order date*. 

As we want buyers to access and place orders from listings we also need the **sellers** to be able to _**post**_ **listings** with _title_, _description, photos_, _pricing(old and current),_ and _category_. A **Seller** can _**edit**_ or _**delete**_ their listing as needed. Each **Listing** also has a **Category**. A **Category** can be _women’s_, _men’s_, _jewelry_, _home_, _pants_, _shirts_, and _shoes_. The **Listings** will also include a _**link**_ to the **sellers profile**. Each **Seller profile** should contain their _name, contact information, Listings_, and their current overall _rating_. Each **Listing** can be _**added**_ to a **Favorites List**. Each **Favorite List** will have the _date_ it was added, _seller ID_.
