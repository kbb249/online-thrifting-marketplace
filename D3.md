# D3. Analysis
## 1. System Description

To use this system, a **User** must register using an *email*, *username*, and *password*. Then the system verifies if the email address is a valid university email. Only verified students can access the platform. Once verified, the user can act both as a **Buyer** and **Seller**. A **Buyer** can **_browse_**, **_search_**, and **_filter_** through all the available listings. When a **Buyer** decides to buy an item, they create a new **Order**. Each **order** has an *order id*, *total amount*, *tax*, and *order date*.
