# D3. Analysis
## 1. System Description

To use this system, a **User** must register using an *email*, *username*, and *password*. Then the system verifies if the email address is a valid university email. Only verified students can access the platform. Once verified, the user can act both as a **Buyer** and **Seller**. A **Buyer** can **_browse_**, **_search_**, and **_filter_** through all the available listings. When a **Buyer** decides to buy an item, they create a new **Order**. Each **order** has an *order id*, *total amount*, *tax*, and *order date*. 

As we want buyers to access and place orders from listings we also need the **sellers** to be able to _**post**_ **listings** with _title_, _description, photos_, _pricing(old and current),_ and _category_. A **Seller** can _**edit**_ or _**delete**_ their listing as needed. Each **Listing** also has a **Category**. A **Category** can be _women’s_, _men’s_, _jewelry_, _home_, _pants_, _shirts_, and _shoes_. The **Listings** will also include a _**link**_ to the **sellers profile**. Each **Seller profile** should contain their _name, contact information, Listings_, and their current overall _rating_. Each **Listing** can be _**added**_ to a **Favorites List**. Each **Favorite List** will have the _date_ it was added, _seller ID_.
