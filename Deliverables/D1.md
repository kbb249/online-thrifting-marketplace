# D.1 Inception
## Introduction
At NAU it is very common to see the social media platform, Snapchat, being used to buy and sell various second-hand items. Without a clear framework for listing or negotiating sales, these informal exchanges often result in disorganized and unreliable transactions. This raises several concerns about safety when buying from unknown vendors. Our product is a website that aims to allow college students to buy and sell items online with in-person pickups. Our website prioritizes safety and accessibility by verifying our user’s student status and establishing pickups in high-traffic areas along with limited interactions between the buyer and seller. A website specifically designed for students on campus would provide an organized interface for buying and selling on campus without the time limits and expensive products that traditional markets have, making the entire process more accessible to a majority of the student population.

## Initial Value Proposition
Students are currently using social media for second-hand selling, and we want to give them a safer, more affordable, and more organized way to buy and sell items on campus. Through this project, we aim to support NAU students who already buy or sell used items and are looking for a more reliable and convenient process.
