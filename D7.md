## 5. Proposed Improvements
**Top 3 improvements needed:** <br>
1. Completed messaging feature.
2. Add broader categories for item listings.
3. Physical pick-up lockers for orders.

**New/Changes Assumptions:** <br>
- We will be working off of the new assumption that not everyone finds selling items via social media as inconvenient, meaning we need to lean into and emphasize the safety and free shipping aspects of our product to draw in users.

**Plans for future validation activities:** <br>
- In the future we will hold a group evaluation activity to encourage potential users to speak their mind in a safe space without judgement, allowing us to acquire more accurate data regarding our website.
