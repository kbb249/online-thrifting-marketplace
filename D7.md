**Qualitative Findings:** <br>
The participant reported that several core features, such as listing an item, editing a listing, and adding items to the cart were intuitive and easy to complete. However, they also expressed uncertainty about whether certain actions, particularly account verification, were successfully completed, noting that there was “no big confirmation.” Navigation challenges were a recurring issue. The participant struggled to locate the reporting feature and the “My Listings” page, stating that “the reporting feature is good, but I couldn’t find it.” They understood that safety reporting tools are important, but the way these features were placed and shown felt confusing, which made them hesitate and spend extra time looking for them.
