# D.4 Implementation 1
## Introduction
Description:
LinkU is an online thrifting marketplace that aims to solve the problem of unsafe and disorganized second-hand markets through social media platforms. While anyone can buy or sell on Snapchat or Facebook Marketplace, our website ensures that users are verified students, then grants them access to an organized website where they can list and buy items as well as safely pick up those items. Our product strives to deliver safer transactions, reduced risk, and a provided platform dedicated to student needs by providing categories for listings, search, filtering, and bookmarks for items, profiles and ratings for sellers, a direct messaging feature for inquiries regarding items, reports for sellers, and a report feature for suspicious or malicious activity.

Value proposition: 
LinkU provides a safe, organized, and affordable way for NAU students to buy and sell used items on campus, reducing the risks and struggles of informal transactions through social media.

MVP: 
The main features for the MVP include a student verification system that checks whether or not the email used to sign up contains “.edu”. Users will be able to login and have access to a basic profile page. We will implement a basic listing system where users can post items for sale with photos, descriptions, and pricing. All listings will be placed in categories. Users will be able to search for specific items and bookmark them for later, as well as be able to contact sellers with private messages. Anyone who lists and sells items should be able to generate reports for sales or user activity so they can improve performance. For the security of our users, we will also have a feature that allows users to report suspicious activity. To pick up items, orders will be assigned to a pick-up locker on campus with an automatically generated random code. Sellers must drop off packages to the correct locker, and buyers can pick them up.

Repository: https://github.com/kbb249/online-thrifting-marketplace

Changes - We are putting physical drop off lockers on the backburner until we can get the basic website functional, putting more focus on the way users interact with our website specifically instead of how they will receive packages and items. We are also putting less emphasis on checking listings against current retail values and rating sellers until we have a more completed version of our website and database.

## Automated Testing

## Technology Stack
__Technology Name:__ nameCheap

__Description:__ this is a hosting site

__Justification:__ this hosting site was chosen mainly because one of the teammates has used it in the past and had found that it is easy to use and has good pricing for students to host their site and claim a domain name. There are also built in functions in the C-Pannel that makes some of the parts of this project  easier. There are security precautions added to websites upon request, It makes our site accessible, works for scalability and has upgrades for better performance as we grow. 


__Technology Name:__ VSCode

__Description__: this is a developmental tool IDE 

__Justification__: each member of the team is completely comfortable with using VSCode as we have all had experience with it. We wanted consistency across what we were using so we all decided this was the best option for us. 


__Technology Name:__ MySQL

__Description:__ MySQL is a database management system. In the terms of this project we are using it to store user accounts. It allows users to gain access to the website. There they can manage their information and update it in our database. This way we can also retrieve the records in the database. 

__Justification:__ This was chosen instead of other DBMS because it is known to be reliable and easy to integrate. Also, we chose to use Namecheap as our hosting platform. This platform offers MySQL embedded into the site. This way we are using systems we know work well with the hosting site. 


__Technology Name:__ JavaScript 

__Description:__ JavaScript is a website coding language and it allows users to use functions and such inside their website. In this case, Javascript is used to call functions from posts created in report logs as well as other features to come.

__Justification:__ This was chosen as one of the main languages used because of its versatility and capabilities in website development. 


__Technology Name:__ Discord  

__Description:__ Communication platform 

__Justification:__ this is a platform that each member had access to already. With a shared knowledge on how to use this platform this was chosen as our best communication site. 

## Learning Strategy

## Deployment
Live System Link:

https://linkuthrifting.com/ 

Deployment Method:

Our deployment method is by a hosting website called namecheap. 

Platform Justification: 

We decided to use namecheap as our deployment method so the website can be available and is easily accessible. We decided on namecheap because of a few reasons but the main ones being cost and accessibility for a group of people being able to access the site and make changes if needed. 


## Licensing
We adopted the MIT licence for our source code 

While doing research on the Licences we found that the MIT licence has the most flexibility for integrating and commercial use. It will allow the modification and private use of the code with minimal restrictions and it doesn't actually require that the changes be shared. We read that this licence is great for startups which technically we are! There is very little legal overhead which just means that the license is easy to understand with no complexities. Once we all break from this class it allows us all to have some flexibility with how we want to continue working on this if we decide to. It will also just protect us just in case someone implements the code we have written that then results in any damages.
