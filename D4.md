## Automated Testing

## Technology Stack
__Technology Name:__ nameCheap

__Description:__ this is a hosting site

__Justification:__ this hosting site was chosen mainly because one of the teammates has used it in the past and had found that it is easy to use and has good pricing for students to host their site and claim a domain name. There are also built in functions in the C-Pannel that makes some of the parts of this project  easier. There are security precautions added to websites upon request, It makes our site accessible, works for scalability and has upgrades for better performance as we grow. 


__Technology Name:__ VSCode

__Description__: this is a developmental tool IDE 

__Justification__: each member of the team is completely comfortable with using VSCode as we have all had experience with it. We wanted consistency across what we were using so we all decided this was the best option for us. 


__Technology Name:__ MySQL

__Description:__ MySQL is a database management system. In the terms of this project we are using it to store user accounts. It allows users to gain access to the website. There they can manage their information and update it in our database. This way we can also retrieve the records in the database. 

__Justification:__ This was chosen instead of other DBMS because it is known to be reliable and easy to integrate. Also, we chose to use Namecheap as our hosting platform. This platform offers MySQL embedded into the site. This way we are using systems we know work well with the hosting site. 


__Technology Name:__ JavaScript 

__Description:__ JavaScript is a website coding language and it allows users to use functions and such inside their website. In this case, Javascript is used to call functions from posts created in report logs as well as other features to come.

__Justification:__ This was chosen as one of the main languages used because of its versatility and capabilities in website development. 


__Technology Name:__ Discord  

__Description:__ Communication platform 

__Justification:__ this is a platform that each member had access to already. With a shared knowledge on how to use this platform this was chosen as our best communication site. 

## Learning Strategy

## Deployment
Live System Link:

https://linkuthrifting.com/ 

Deployment Method:

Our deployment method is by a hosting website called namecheap. 

Platform Justification: 

We decided to use namecheap as our deployment method so the website can be available and is easily accessible. We decided on namecheap because of a few reasons but the main ones being cost and accessibility for a group of people being able to access the site and make changes if needed. 


## Licensing
We adopted the MIT licence for our source code 

While doing research on the Licences we found that the MIT licence has the most flexibility for integrating and commercial use. It will allow the modification and private use of the code with minimal restrictions and it doesn't actually require that the changes be shared. We read that this licence is great for startups which technically we are! There is very little legal overhead which just means that the license is easy to understand with no complexities. Once we all break from this class it allows us all to have some flexibility with how we want to continue working on this if we decide to. It will also just protect us just in case someone implements the code we have written that then results in any damages.
