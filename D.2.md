## **Positioning**
### *Problem Statement:*
The problem of unsafe and disorganized second hand selling through social media platforms affects NAU students who want to buy and sell items on campus. The impact of this problem is that students face safety risks when meeting unknown sellers, experience unreliable transactions, and lack an affordable system for selling used items.

### *Product Position Statement*
For NAU students who want a safe, reliable, and organized way to buy and sell second hand items on campus, LinkU is an online marketplace that verifies student status, organizes listings, and supports safe pickups at campus locations, unlike Snapchat or Facebook Marketplace, our product has safer transactions, reduces risk, and provides a platform dedicated to student needs.

### *Value Proposition and Customer Segment*
LinkU provides a safe, organized, and affordable way for NAU students to buy and sell used items on campus, reducing the risks and headaches of informal transactions through social media. It targets students who have previously bought or sold second-hand items on campus and want a safer, more organized and secure way to carry out these transactions.
