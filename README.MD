# Project Title

This is the GitHub repository for LinkU Online Thrifting Marketplace! In here you will find all the different files for the website itself. It features a home page, catalog page, user signup page, report page and etc!
This repository also features our deliverables.
## Getting Started

To get started in working with this repository, you will first need to download the code files.
### Prerequisites

When all the files are installed, it is needed to sort them into a folder. Once the folder is made, create folders called public and views.
The CSS files will mainly be stored in the public folder.
The other folders such as the catalog pages or any other of the .ejs files will be stored in views.
Any of the other files such as the js files can be stored in either the main folder or the connecting folder the .js is for.
### Installing
After implementing all of these folders into your system you can finally open up Visual Studio Code! Once this is done and the folder is opened, open up your terminal and run:
"node linku-app.js"
If this worked correctly without error, it should run on your localhost and be ready for editing or work.
