# Project Title

This is the GitHub repository for LinkU Online Thrifting Marketplace! In here you will find all the different files for the website itself. It features a home page, catalog page, user signup page, report page and etc!
This repository also features our deliverables.
## Getting Started

To get started in working with this repository, you will first need to download the code files.
### Prerequisites

When all the files are installed, it is needed to sort them into a folder. Once the folder is made, create folders inside called public and views.
The CSS files will mainly be stored in the public folder.
The other folders such as the catalog pages or any other of the .ejs files will be stored in views.
Any of the other files such as the js files can be stored in either the main folder or the connecting folder the .js is for.
Follow the formatting for the files based off the ones inside the GitHub repository.
### Installing
After implementing all of these folders into your system you can finally open up Visual Studio Code!
First open up the folder containing the linku code and then open the terminal
Run the command npm init -y, this will run the packages needed for the code. 
Next run the command to install the required packages:
npm install ejs express url socketio
Once this is done and the folder is opened, open up your terminal and run:
"node linku-app.js"
If this worked correctly without error, it should run on your localhost and be ready for editing or work.

## Running the tests

Testing is currently in progress (TBD), but will include:
Unit Tests – Verifying backend routes and EJS rendering.
Integration Tests – Ensuring the server communicates properly with client-side pages.
UI/UX Tests – Checking that each webpage loads correctly and links function as expected.
Breakdown into end-to-end tests

These tests will simulate full user activity such as:
Creating an account and logging in.
Viewing and filtering the catalog.
Reporting a seller or suspicious activity.
Submitting and viewing reports in the admin log.
