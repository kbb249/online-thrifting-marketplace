Kaylee Cromwell

Interview date: 09/18/2025

Customer segment represented in the interview: University Student

Key insights from the interview:

1.	Types of fabrics and sizing.
2.	Likes the idea of buying and selling clothes but does not due to safety and cost. 
3.	Does not like the idea of meeting up with someone in person when she does not know them.

Representative quotes:

“ I prefer to buy clothes in person so I can see what types of fabric things are and to see if the clothes are in good condition. If I knew some more details than the basic one like size and if worn, I may be more likely to buy clothes used online. ”

“ On social media there is always the possibility of be catfished so don’t feel that I could trust them. ”

Assessment: Nice to have
