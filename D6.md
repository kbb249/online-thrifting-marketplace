## Automated Testing
### Unit Tests:
Test Framework: Jest <br>
GitHub Folder Link: https://github.com/kbb249/online-thrifting-marketplace/tree/main/cs386/Automated%20Testing <br>
Example of a Unit Test: 
- File Being Tested Link: https://github.com/kbb249/online-thrifting-marketplace/blob/main/cs386/public/catalog.js<br>
- Test File: https://github.com/kbb249/online-thrifting-marketplace/blob/main/cs386/Automated%20Testing/catalog.test.js <br> 
- Brief Explanation: These tests check that the loadCatalog() function behaves correctly when it tries to fetch item data from the server. They make sure the function returns the real data when the fetch works and returns an empty array when the fetch fails, instead of crashing. To do this, the tests mock (fake) the fetch function, so no real network request is made, and they also mock console.error so the error messages don’t appear in the test output. <br>
