# D.6 Implementation 2
## Introduction

Description:

LinkU is an online thrifting marketplace that aims to provide a solution for the problem of unsafe and disorganized second-hand markets through social media platforms. Many NAU students risk meeting unknown sellers, experience unreliable transactions, and lack an affordable system for selling used items. LinkU will allow student verification status, organization with listing and buying items, as well as support safe pickups at campus locations. Our product strives to deliver safer transactions, reduced risk, and a provided platform dedicated to student needs. LinkU targets students who have previously bought or sold second-hand items on campus and want a safer, more organized and secure way to carry out these transactions.


Value proposition: 

LinkU provides a safe, organized, and affordable way for NAU students to buy and sell used items on campus, reducing the risks and struggles of informal transactions through social media.


MVP: 

The main features for the MVP include a student verification system. Users will be able to login and have access to a basic profile page. We will implement a basic listing system where users can post items for sale with photos, descriptions, and pricing. Users will be able to search for specific items as well as contact sellers with private messages. Anyone who lists and sells items should be able to generate reports for sales or user activity so they can improve performance. For the security of our users, we will also have a feature that allows users to report suspicious activity. To pick up items, orders will be assigned to a pick-up locker on campus with an automatically generated random code. Sellers must drop off packages to the correct locker, and buyers can pick them up.


Repository: https://github.com/kbb249/online-thrifting-marketplace


Changes: 

For the implementation of our website, we are removing the categories feature in favor of simplicity. The only other major change to our system is that we will be refraining from creating a bookmarking feature for now until the basics of our website are implemented.

## Automated Testing
### Unit Tests:
Test Framework: Jest <br>
GitHub Folder Link: https://github.com/kbb249/online-thrifting-marketplace/tree/main/cs386/Automated%20Testing <br>
Example of a Unit Test: 
- File Being Tested Link: https://github.com/kbb249/online-thrifting-marketplace/blob/main/cs386/public/catalog.js<br>
- Test File: https://github.com/kbb249/online-thrifting-marketplace/blob/main/cs386/Automated%20Testing/catalog.test.js <br> 
- Brief Explanation: These tests check that the loadCatalog() function behaves correctly when it tries to fetch item data from the server. They make sure the function returns the real data when the fetch works and returns an empty array when the fetch fails, instead of crashing. To do this, the tests mock (fake) the fetch function, so no real network request is made, and they also mock console.error so the error messages don’t appear in the test output. <br>

### Integration Tests:

Framework - Pytest

Github folder link: https://github.com/kbb249/online-thrifting-marketplace/tree/main/cs386/Automated%20Testing

Test file: https://github.com/kbb249/online-thrifting-marketplace/blob/main/cs386/Automated%20Testing/integration_test.py
Explanation: 

This code tests the full user interface of the website and tests what a normal user accessing our website would go through at the current state. It tests for signing up and when run, must be inputted with a new user or it won’t function properly. After signing up it will use that sign up information and test for logging in. Once it is successfully logged in it will create an item for listing and check if the item was listed.

Using only the source code itself (ignoring comments), produce a thorough maintainability assessment. Your analysis should cover architecture, design, and code quality. For each category, identify specific issues, explain why they reduce maintainability, and support your points with concrete evidence such as file paths, function or variable names, and short code snippets. Provide clear, code-level recommendations for improvement without suggesting external tools or frameworks. Include a brief overall summary, a prioritized checklist of the most important fixes, and one example showing how a problematic function or module could be refactored. Do not ask follow-up questions; base your entire report solely on the code provided.

      <li>AI Feedback:</li>
      <li> <span style="color:orange">Design Issue: Heavy innerHTML With Unescaped User Data: --</span>. 
  Your catalog and card-rendering logic rely on inserting user-supplied fields (item name, description, price, category, image path) directly into innerHTML strings. Because innerHTML interprets the content as HTML, this creates a major XSS vulnerability and makes the UI fragile. If an item contains characters like <, ", or embedded tags, the browser will parse them as actual HTML instead of text. This also harms maintainability because large template strings mix data, markup, and logic in the same place. Editing the layout requires sifting through complex string interpolation, and it’s easy to break the HTML structure accidentally. With multiple developers or future revisions, the risk of unintended markup changes is high.
  </li>
      <li><span style="color:orange"> Architecture Issue: Duplicated Cart Logic --</span>.
  Functions that manage cart state — saving changes, adjusting quantities, merging items — appear in multiple files, including both catalog and cart scripts. Because they aren’t centralized in a single module, the same logic is repeated and maintained in parallel. This duplication makes the system brittle. If one copy is updated (e.g., to change how items are stored or how quantities are calculated) but the other copy is not, cart behavior becomes inconsistent depending on which page the user was on. Over time, the duplicated logic is likely to diverge, turning small changes into system-wide bugs.</li>
      <li>Assigned Reviewer: Alexa Aguilar</li>
      <li>Severity Assessment: [High]</li>
      <li>Decision: [Approved]</li>
      <li>Explanation: We improved the project by creating one shared cart file called cart-module.js, which holds all the functions for adding, removing, and updating items in the cart. Before this, each page had its own copy of the   cart code, which made things confusing and hard to fix. Now everything uses the same set of cart functions. We also cleaned up how the cart page is built by using real elements (like images, buttons, and text nodes) instead of large innerHTML strings.

**AI Feedback:**
1. Monolithic structure-> I'm using the database connection in every single file. It expressed this would cause it to be hard to reuse the logic and scale. 
2. Security risks! -> the js only restricts who sees the edit and delete anyone can open the DevTools and submit a deleteitem. Adding a CSRF token will add a layer of security. 

**Assigned Reviewer:** Zazel Turner 

**Severity assessment:** Overall Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH/

- Authentication Risk — LOW
- Client-Side Access Control — MEDIUM
- CSRF Vulnerability — HIGH

**Decision:** implement changes a and b to the system. 

**Explanation:**

Changes made:
  
1. I did agree with the assessment that the structure is monolithic and will not be reusable. In doing research i found that using a /config.php file is a common way to have the database connection. So   i did create a file that had the connection and then included it at the top of each of my php files. 

New configuration file:

This previously was in each of my php files. Now i have one for user activity, user information, messaging information, and item information connections. This makes the maintainability and reusability much better. 

2. This is the part of the system that got a high severity risk. So i did go back and add the CSRF token to the edit and delete actions so that it is required to make those changes. Here are a couple of the lines I added to the php, and html to create the token.

**Reflection:** I think that the AI assessment helped me improve the security of this system in a way that really mattered. I did not know that someone could go into the devTools and do a fraudulent action like delete or edit items with how we had it structured. Not only did it help with the security in this way it also helped make this code much more reusable. Because i am more of a beginner on backend handling i think this provided great insight and recommendations on how to create the config file and improve the system

**Detailed Analysis and Response:**

**AI Feedback:** 
- “Your current JS mixes DOM manipulation with a POST request, is missing the url variable, and references non-existent form elements.”
- “Your previous JS/PHP contained several issues:
  ❌ Input not sanitized
  ❌ Allows forged requests
  ❌ Probably missing session auth
  ❌ Raw HTML insertion causes XSS
  ❌ No CSRF protection
  Fix with:
  Prepared statements
  htmlspecialchars() on all message output
  Token-based validation
  Sessions restricting who can send messages”

**Detailed Analysis and Response:**
Right now your list-group sits in a plain <div>. Using <nav> makes it more accessible and semantic. You have several my-5 and mb-5 that can be simplified using groups of spacing classes. You're missing the closing </footer> content. Either remove it or add content. You already do this for some fields, but you should add it to all inputs—especially switches. Updating settings should happen inside a <form> — improves structure and eases JS/plugin integration. You already do this; just make sure each has its own internal structure, which you’ve mostly done right. Add aria- labels for navigation. Helps screen readers. Add Bootstrap spacing utilities for “setting-item”.You manually spaced them using d-flex. You manually spaced them using d-flex. Or use your own CSS. If you want a nicer experience, add JavaScript so the active tab changes as you scroll or click.

**Detailed Analysis and Response:**
Use more semantic tags to make the page easier to understand for screen readers and future developers. When items update dynamically, screen readers won’t know unless you add: <span id="cart-item-count" aria-live="polite">0</span> <span id="cart-subtotal" aria-live="polite">0.00</span>.Wrap the Order Summary in a <form> if Checkout Leads to a Form. You already do this nicely, but consider adding <div id="order-summary" class="card shadow-sm">. Ensure Consistent Container StructureBootstrap recommends using .container only once per main content area. Optional: Add Loading State for Long JS Fetch, If cart.js fetches stored cart data, you can make UX smoother. Clean Up the Inline HTML With Meaningful Comments, Add comments to help future you (or teammates).

## Retrospective Analysis
1. **Key Learnings:** Developing LinkU gave us critical insights, primarily related to security and the codebase's architecture:
* Security is Server-Side, Not Client-Side: Our biggest lesson was recognizing the complete failure of client-side access control. We learned that relying on JavaScript to restrict access is useless. Determined users can easily bypass it and submit fraudulent requests. This immediately meant we needed a shift to robust server-side security.
* Scalability: Using the database connection code in every single PHP file led to a monolithic structure that was difficult to reuse and scale.
* AI Insight: The use of an AI tool for code analysis was invaluable. It quickly flagged severe structural and security risks that we, as a team, missed, providing the exact blueprint needed for our high-priority fixes.

2. **Challenges Overcome:** We successfully addressed high-priority security and structural challenges:
* Eliminating the CSRF Vulnerability: The project was exposed to a High Severity Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) risk, which could have allowed attackers to delete or edit listings. We fixed this by implementing and enforcing a CSRF token for all edit and delete actions on the backend.
* Refactoring for Maintainability: We connected the initial monolithic code structure by reorganizing the database logic. Instead of repeating connection code everywhere, we created distinct, reusable configuration files for user activity, item information, and messaging connections.
  
3. **Future Improvements:** To continue improving LinkU, we would focus heavily on hardening security and polishing the user-facing experience:
* Harden Messaging Security: The private messaging system is currently a major security liability. We must immediately implement “prepared statements” and use “output sanitization” to block cross-site scripting in all messages.
* Optimize User Experience: User interaction is key, so we must elevate the experience around managing items. This involves adopting a “responsive card grid” for listings, using “toast notifications” for fast user feedback on saves/deletes, and converting the static edit form into a smooth, centered “modal”.
